SwayNC config with glassmorphism
## You should add these lines to your `hyprland.conf`
```
layerrule = blur, swaync-control-center
layerrule = ignorezero, swaync-notification-window
layerrule = animation slide right, swaync-control-center
```


I took their config as a base: @elifouts dotfiles/swaync
